                                The "optimal" treatment wasn't working for me.

                        <p>
                            The brain fog and constant fatigue made me a stranger to myself. At first I thought it was exhaustion from working too much but no amount of rest worked. I couldn't think clearly or quickly, which meant I couldn't work or study.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="pull-quote">

                                Life stopped at my best moment, just when things were starting to go really well.

                            Desperate and without strength, I couldn't stop searching for a solution, even if it was at the speed of a lame turtle. First I went to dozens of doctors until I got my diagnosis, and then, using my academic background, I began reading hundreds of research articles to understand what was happening to me and why the treatment wasn't working.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I finally understood that my symptoms had already been studied by many endocrinologists. They had proposals to solve it: rigorous studies showed that cortisol pumps could mimic the body's natural rhythms and significantly improve quality of life... But... they weren't available to me.

                            <p>Commercial drug infusion pumps cost... $3,000. $4,500. $6,500 dollars, and even if I could buy them, they didn't deliver medications with the rhythms required for cortisol. My heart sank. Not only were they extremely expensive, but they weren't available in my country.</p>

                            <p>But I never give up. I expanded my search and found an article about an $89 insulin pump that worked as well as the expensive ones and could be reprogrammed because it was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source">"open source"</a>. The researchers had shared everything for free: bill of materials, assembly instructions, 3D print-ready design... and all without patents or barriers.</p>
